Stretch Questions

            inline - An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
            block - A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block;
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
